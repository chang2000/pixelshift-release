## Usage

Upload several wallpapers, then click on the image to switch. To start over, click on the trash can to empty your selection. It's as simple as that!

## Motivation

As macOS evolves, the system's default wallpaper library continues to grow. This can make it challenging to easily set wallpapers from a user's folder. To solve this problem, I created this little app.
